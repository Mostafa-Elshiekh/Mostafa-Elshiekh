## Overview about me  
Embedded Software Engineer passionate about learning, research, and innovation in embedded systems. Highly motivated to explore new technologies and apply them to real-world projects. With one year of experience in designing, developing, testing, debugging, and optimizing embedded software, expertise in Basic Software (BSW), including CCP, MemMap, NVM, CAN/CANFD, and Vehicle Network.
Skilled in software integration, reusability, and portability for automotive and industrial applications, ensuring high-performance, reliable, and scalable solutions. Proficient in CANalyzer, CANape, TSMaster, and TI Microcontrollers.

**Developed CAN Calibration Protocol (CCP) Stack:**
>*Real-Time Monitoring: Developed a CCP stack that provide  real-time monitoring of system variables over the CAN bus.
>*Calibration: Developed write operation functionality in the CCP, enabling the modification of ECU variable values directly over the CAN bus to support the >*calibration concept. This eliminates the need for additional debugging hardware, relying solely on the CCP SW, CAN bus, and calibration tool.
>*Flexibility and Portability: Designed the solution to be highly flexible, portable, and isolated from specific hardware.
>*Testing: Tested the protocol extensively with multiple ECUs on the CAN bus, successfully establishing, terminating, and managing connections using their specific >*addresses—verified monitoring and calibration functionality across all data types.
     Tools :
     1. Code Composer.       2. C programming.      3. Python (A2L file generation)       4. CANape/TsMaster      5.CANalyzer    6.TI Microcontroller. 


     
**Developed a MemMap Module for Memory Allocation Control:**
>*Developed a MemMap Module to effectively manage and control memory allocation across different sections. 
>*Managed Flash memory sections, including Code, Calibration (CALIB), and Constant sections.
>*Managed RAM sections, including Initialized Variables, Cleared Variables, Power-On Initialization, and Power-On Clear.
>*Ensured the MemMap Module was fully aligned with AUTOSAR specifications for standardized memory allocation control.
     Tools :
     1. Code Composer.       2. C programming.      3. TI Microcontroller. 
     
**FEE Driver Implementation:**
>*Developed the Flash EEPROM Emulation (FEE) driver to provide non-volatile memory (NVM) functionality, allowing the system to save critical data in flash memory >*during shutdown and restore it on startup.
>*Write a test component for the Flash Emulation Driver (FEE) to validate processes by writing blocks to the flash sector, filling  them, shutting down, and >*restarting. It tests Read_All, Write_All, and Garbage Collection to ensure data integrity, and includes checks for data consistency, sector swapping, and garbage >*collection.    
     Tools :
     1. Code Composer.       2. C programming.      3. TI Microcontroller.

**System Interface with Vehicle Network:**
>*Developed a component within the COM module to send and receive messages from the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU), ensuring compliance with the required CAN signal >*parameters, including name, length, offset, gain, initialization, and frame.
>*Write a test module to validate network messages and signals, ensuring the accuracy of all TX and RX signals with multiple data types.
>*Created a CANalyzer-based dashboard to simulate VCU functionality for testing and monitoring purposes.
     Tools :
     1. Code Composer.        2. C programming.      3. DBC file       3.CANalyzer (Monitoring CAN Bus + Dashboard Panel)       4.TI Microcontroller.
